## But why ?

If you're somewhat like me, you like having correct icons of file formats next to file lists in your IDE.

And if you're *even more* like me, you've been bothered by the fact that there's no specific icon for `.jsx` and `.tsx` files.
So this is just my attempt at making one of them.
This is how it looks like on my IDE :

Both logos are heavily inspired by [the OpenJSX logo](https://github.com/OpenJSX/logo), except the text is larger here for a better legibility.
